rover Perseverance, and a little helicopter named Ingenuity, for the dramatic and safe landing at the Jezero Crater on Mars! With the rover's mission successfully underway on the surface of the Red Planet, it is time to add the details of the Mars 2020 Mission to this list of American interplanetary spacecraft photo gear.</p><p ><amp-img layout="responsive" alt="" class="image-960" src="https://static.bhphotovideo.com/explora/sites/default/files/styles/960/public/324271main_tiros_full.jpg?itok=RR_BamYD" width="800" height="600" /></p><p>The first photograph of Earth from space was taken by the TIROS-1 weather satellite on April 1, 1960. Ever since, satellites, probes, and spacecraft have been taking amazing photos of the solar system and beyond! Space probes are packed with sensors, but in our list below, we wanted to talk about those imaging systems that are relatively close cousins to what you can find on the shelves of the B&amp;H SuperStore.</p><h3>1. Cassini</h3><p>Launched in 1997, Cassini orbited the crown jewel of the solar system, Saturn and its and moons until fall of 2017 when it was intentionally flown into Saturn's atmosphere to prevent an unavoidable possible future collision with the Saturnian moon, Enceladus, which may harbor extraterrestrial life. The Cassini probe was equipped with various optical sensors and one optical camera that has captured amazing images of the ringed planet. The spacecraft's Huygens Probe landed on the moon, Titan. Cassini's Imaging Science Subsystem (ISS) consists of a wide- and narrow-angle camera. Both cameras feature a CCD sensor of 12 micron pixels numbering 1024 x 1024, with a resolving power that can see a quarter-dollar at a range of 2.5 miles.</p><div class="caption-div"><figure class="caption-figure caption-image-body"><amp-img layout="responsive" alt="" class="image-960" src="https://static.bhphotovideo.com/explora/sites/default/files/styles/960/public/cassini.jpg?itok=WiLmfUBq" width="960" height="640" /><figcaption>Cassini sails over the rings of Saturn <em>(artist's rendition)</em>.</figcaption></figure></div><p>Each camera has two filter wheels-9 filters for the wide-angle and 18 for the narrow-angle camera-to limit specific wavelengths of light, and the cameras sent back an average of 2,700 photos to Earth each month, including frames to verify Cassini's position in space, using celestial navigation, as there is definitely no GPS on Saturn!</p><div class="caption-div"><figure class="caption-figure caption-image-body"><a href=https://www.bhphotovideo.com/explora/photography/features/cameras-on-32-interplanetary-spacecraft class="colorbox colorbox-insert-image" rel=nofollow><amp-img layout="responsive" alt="" class="image-960" src="https://static.bhphotovideo.com/explora/sites/default/files/styles/960/public/PIA07772.jpg?itok=gAjPCA2i" width="956" height="960" /></a><figcaption>Saturn and its stately rings</figcaption></figure></div><h3>2. Dawn</h3><p>Launched in 2007, Dawn orbited the protoplanet Vesta (2011) and dwarf planet Ceres (2015) before its ion propulsion system ran out of fuel, in November 2018. Vesta and Ceres are the largest objects in the asteroid belt between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter.

Deep Impact</h3><p>Deep Impact launched in 2005 toward the comet Tempel 1 and, less than 7 months after launch, the probe released an impactor that struck the comet's surface. Deep Impact carried two cameras, a High Resolution Instrument (HRI), an 11.8" telescope, and a Medium Resolution Instrument (HRI), a 4.7" telescope. The MRI served as a functional backup to the HRI, as well as a celestial navigation tool. The impactor carried a targeting camera.</p><div class="caption-div"><figure class="caption-figure caption-image-body"><amp-img layout="responsive" alt="" class="image-960" src="https://static.bhphotovideo.com/explora/sites/default/files/styles/960/public/deep_impact.jpg?itok=36YPR1zu" width="960" height="640" /><figcaption>Deep Impact<em> (artist's rendition)</em></figcaption></figure></div><p>The HRI was one of the largest cameras flown into space on a planetary mission and had a resolution of 6' per pixel at 435 miles. The MRI's wide-angle system had a resolution of 33' per pixel at the same range. Unfortunately, the HRI's images were blurry for the comet encounter, but there were plans to repurpose the camera and probe to look for planets orbiting distant stars.</p><div class="caption-div"><figure class="caption-figure caption-image-body"><a href=https://www.bhphotovideo.com/explora/photography/features/cameras-on-32-interplanetary-spacecraft class="colorbox colorbox-insert-image" rel=nofollow><amp-img layout="responsive" alt="" class="image-960" src="https://static.bhphotovideo.com/explora/sites/default/files/styles/960/public/pia02137_1.jpg?itok=LJhUvgyA" width="900" height="900" /></a><figcaption>This spectacular image of comet Tempel 1 was taken 67 seconds after it obliterated Deep Impact's impactor spacecraft. The image was taken by the high-resolution camera on the mission's flyby craft. Scattered light from the collision saturated the camera's detector, creating the bright splash seen here. Linear spokes of light radiate away from the impact site, while reflected sunlight illuminates most of the comet surface. The image reveals topographic features, including ridges, scalloped edges and possibly impact craters formed long ago.</figcaption></figure></div><h3>4. Deep Space 1</h3><p>Pioneering ion propulsion technology, Deep Space 1 was launched in 1998 and flew by the asteroid 9969 Braille and the comet Borelly. The craft's Miniature Integrated Camera and Imaging Spectrometer (MICAS) was a 26.5-lb package containing two black-and-white cameras and other imaging equipment.</p><div class="caption-div"><figure class="caption-figure caption-image-body"><amp-img layout="responsive" alt="" class="image-960" src="https://static.bhphotovideo.com/explora/sites/default/files/styles/960/public/deep_space_1.jpg?itok=LJNUvY_l" width="960" height="770" /><figcaption>Deep Space 1 <em>(artist's rendition)</em></figcaption></figure></div><p>All of the sensors shared the same 4" diameter telescope and electronic shutters.

The Near IR camera was also a 96mm f/3.33 catadioptric telescope with a six-filter wheel, and the Long Wavelength IR camera had a 96mm f/2.67 catadioptric lens. The HiRes camera consisted of a Beryllium telescope and CCD imager. The Star Trackers featured a concentric-optics design with a fiber optic field flattener and 576 x 384 pixel CCD array. These cameras were used for imaging and to verify the spacecraft's position using celestial navigation. A Charged Particle Telescope and Laser Image Detection and Ranging (LIDAR) system rounded out the equipment suite.</p><div class="bnh-collage-wrap bnh-collage-type-table_2_0 "><figure class="bnh-collage-figure"><div class="bnh-collage-wrap-inside"><div class="bnh-collage-image-wrap bnh-collage-wrap-image-0"><div class="bnh-collage-image"><a href=https://www.bhphotovideo.com/explora/photography/features/cameras-on-32-interplanetary-spacecraft title="" class="bnh-collage-image-link colorbox" rel="a"><amp-img layout="responsive" src="https://static.bhphotovideo.com/explora/sites/default/files/styles/bnh_collage/public/bnh_collage/tsc/476x536_50x50_9a-clementine-north-pole.jpg?itok=9UKOUWS2&amp;focal_point=50,50" alt="" title="" width="476" height="536" /></a></div></div><div class="bnh-collage-image-wrap bnh-collage-wrap-image-1"><div class="bnh-collage-image"><a href=https://www.bhphotovideo.com/explora/photography/features/cameras-on-32-interplanetary-spacecraft title="" class="bnh-collage-image-link colorbox" rel="a"><amp-img layout="responsive" src="https://static.bhphotovideo.com/explora/sites/default/files/styles/bnh_collage/public/bnh_collage/tsc/476x536_50x50_9b-clementine-south-pole.jpg?itok=hrVgZQZk&amp;focal_point=50,50" alt="" title="" width="476" height="536" /></a></div></div></div><figcaption class="bnh-collage-caption bnh-collage-caption-table">Mosaics of both lunar poles</figcaption></figure></div><p>After leaving lunar orbit, in May 1994, a computer error caused a thruster to fire and placed the spacecraft in an 80 rpm spin. This canceled a follow-on mission to the asteroid Geographos. However, the probe has cemented its place in history by being the first spacecraft to map the entire lunar surface topographically and, 4 years after studying the data, it was revealed that Clementine had discovered water ice in the moon's deep polar craters-enough to support a lunar colony or create rocket fuel for further space exploration.</p><h3>6. Galileo</h3><p>Leaving Earth in 1989 onboard the Space Shuttle <em>Atlantis</em>, Galileo headed for the Jovian System, visiting two asteroids on its way to the gas giant. While in orbit around Jupiter, it was eyewitness to the collision between the Schumacher-Levy comet and the huge planet. The spacecraft was a spinning platform, but the part with the camera remained stationary. The Solid State Imager (SSI) was an 800 x 800-pixel CCD camera. Galileo was the first CCD-equipped spacecraft. To protect the CCD from Jupiter's radiation, the camera was shielded with tantalum. An 8-filter wheel allowed filtering of different colors.</p><div class="caption-div"><figure class="caption-figure caption-image-body"><amp-img layout="responsive" alt="" class="image-960" src="https://static.bhphotovideo.com/explora/sites/default/files/styles/960/public/galileo_0.jpg?itok=sefXPpyB" width="960" height="772" /><figcaption>Galileo <em>(artist's rendition)</em></figcaption></figure></div><p>In 2003, Galileo was intentionally crashed into Jupiter's atmosphere to prevent possibly contaminating the moon Europa with Earth-based material.</p><div class="caption-div"><figure class="caption-figure caption-image-body"><a href=https://www.bhphotovideo.com/explora/photography/features/cameras-on-32-interplanetary-spacecraft class="colorbox colorbox-insert-image" rel=nofollow><amp-img layout="responsive" alt="" class="image-960" src="https://static.bhphotovideo.com/explora/sites/default/files/styles/960/public/PIA19048_ip.jpg?itok=0fszB4mi" width="812" height="600" /></a><figcaption>The surface of Jupiter's icy moon, Europa</figcaption></figure></div><h3>7. Insight</h3><p>Launched from Vandenberg Air Force Base, in May 2018, Insight touched down on the Red Planet on November 26, 2018. Notably, this is NASA's first West Coast interplanetary launch and, another first, Insight will be accompanied to Mars by two small CubeSats-Mars Cube One or MarCO-nicknamed "Eva" and "Wall-E." Its science objectives are more inner-looking at the planet, and less visual. The lander will study the formation of terrestrial planets by investigating the internal structure of Mars while determining the current levels of seismic activity on Mars to gauge tectonic movements and meteor impacts on the surface.</p><div class="caption-div"><figure class="caption-figure caption-image-body"><a href=https://www.bhphotovideo.com/explora/photography/features/cameras-on-32-interplanetary-spacecraft class="colorbox colorbox-insert-image" rel=nofollow><amp-img layout="responsive" alt="" class="image-960" src="https://static.bhphotovideo.com/explora/sites/default/files/styles/960/public/nasa_insight.jpg?itok=7BVsI03v" width="960" height="720" /></a><figcaption>Mars Insight</figcaption></figure></div><p>But, even though the craft is studying the inside of Mars, we may as well snap some photos while there.

The IDC is aimed by the arm, has a 45-degree field of view, and the capability of making 360-degree panoramic images of the landing site. The ICC has a 120-degree field of view for wide-angle monitoring of the work site.</p><p>The two CubeSats are both equipped with dual cameras, as well. Both MarCo's have a color wide-field engineering camera with a 138-degree field of view. This camera is used to confirm the antenna deployment.

Lunar Orbiter Series</h3><p>From 1966 through 1967, in the run-up to the manned Apollo moon missions, NASA sent five unmanned spacecraft to orbit the moon, named Lunar Orbiter I through V, with a mission to capture images of the surface. The goal of the first three missions was to survey possible landing sites that would be suitable for the Apollo lunar modules. Meeting the survey goals, the last two probes had more scientific purposes.

Mars 2020</h3><p>The Mars 2020 Mission and Perseverance rover launched to Mars from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station on board an Atlas V-541 rocket on July 30, 2020 and landed successfully, on February 18,<span > </span>2021. The Perseverance rover is similar to the Curiosity rover that landed on Mars in 2012 <em>(see below)</em> but with more advanced equipment (obviously). It is 10' long and, if you are keeping score at home, the largest and heaviest Mars rover ever built by NASA. The intricate landing procedure was similar to the complex parachute/rocket/sky-crane maneuver that set Curiosity down on the Red Planet and was known in social media circles as the "Seven Minutes of Terror."</p><p>Does Perseverance have cameras? Um, yes. It has 19 cameras with 23 "eyes!" This sets a record for the number of cameras on an interplanetary exploration!</p><p>Perseverance will search for signs of ancient microbial life, characterize the planet's geology and climate, and collect carefully selected and documented rock and sediment samples for possible return to Earth. This work will pave the way for human exploration beyond the Moon.</p><p>Before we dive into the camera details, as a former military helicopter pilot, I am excited to report that a little helicopter named Ingenuity is riding on board Perseverance and, if all goes according to plan, will be the first controlled aircraft to fly on another planet (that we know of)!</p><div class="caption-div"><figure class="caption-figure caption-image-body"><a href=https://www.bhphotovideo.com/explora/photography/features/cameras-on-32-interplanetary-spacecraft class="colorbox colorbox-insert-image" rel=nofollow><amp-img layout="responsive" alt="" class="image-960" src="https://static.bhphotovideo.com/explora/sites/default/files/styles/960/public/ingenuity.png?itok=ze3qR0T3" width="960" height="539" /></a><figcaption>Artist rendition of the Ingenuity helicopter</figcaption></figure></div><p>OK, let's talk about these record-setting cameras which we can break down into three categories: Descent Imaging Cameras, Engineering Cameras, and Science Cameras.</p><div class="caption-div"><figure class="caption-figure caption-image-body"><a href=https://www.bhphotovideo.com/explora/photography/features/cameras-on-32-interplanetary-spacecraft class="colorbox colorbox-insert-image" rel=nofollow><amp-img layout="responsive" alt="" class="image-960" src="https://static.bhphotovideo.com/explora/sites/default/files/styles/960/public/perseverance-2.png?itok=YCiMDBsk" width="960" height="508" /></a><figcaption>Artist rendition of the "Sky Crane" landing.</figcaption></figure></div><p>When Curiosity executed its complex and nerve-wracking touchdown on the Red Planet, there was one camera recording the event-the Mars Descent Imager (MARDI). Perseverance adds commercially available cameras and a microphone to record the journey-one looking up to record the parachute deployment from the descent stage, a camera looking down from the descent stage at the lander, a rover camera looking up to see the descent stage operation, and a rover camera looking down at the rapidly approaching Martian Surface.</p><p>The main Engineering Camera is the dual color stereo Navigation Cameras on the rover's mast-Navcams. The lenses are 16.5" apart. They can see a golf ball-sized target from 82' away. The Navcam's sensor provides a 20MP 5120 x 3840 pixel image. Navigation cameras on previous rovers were 1MP black-and-white imagers. This is quite an upgrade!</p><p>The CacheCam is a single camera that creates microscopic images to catalog sample materials as they are stored in tubes and sealed.</p><p>The first Science Camera is the Mastcam-Z color camera that rides atop the rover's mast at the height of a 6.5' tall person. It can swivel 360<sup></sup> and straight up and down. Two lenses are separated by 9.5" to provide stereo vision for the 1600 x 1200 pixel sensor. The "Z" on the camera name designates its 3:1 zoom capability.</p><p>Perseverance's SuperCam examines rocks and soils with a combination of camera, laser, and spectrometers. From a distance of 20' away, it can fire the laser at targets as small as a pencil point. It is known as a micro-imager and not closely related to the digital cameras with which we are familiar.</p><p>The other Science Cameras are PIXL, SHERLOC, and WATSON, which are all used in sample analysis.</p><h3>13. Mariner Series</h3><p>Last, the Ingenuity helicopter carries two small B&amp;W digital cameras on board for navigation.</p><p>Some of the Mariner probes carried cameras, some did not. Mariner 6 and Mariner 7, launched in 1969, carried wide-angle and narrow-angle cameras and a digital tape recorder for the data. Mariner 9, launched in 1971, had the same photographic payload.

Solar Orbiter</h3><p>Launched in February 2020 on board an Atlas V rocket from Cape Canaveral, Florida, the Solar Orbiter is a cooperative effort between NASA and the European Space Agency (ESA) launched to investigate how the Sun creates and controls the ever-changing space environment surrounding our solar system-the heliosphere. The probe will orbit the Sun every 168 days, once it reaches the central star of our system, and join the Parker Solar Probe <em>(see above)</em> in investigating and unlocking some of the Sun's most perplexing secrets.</p><div class="caption-div"><figure class="caption-figure caption-image-body"><a href=https://www.bhphotovideo.com/explora/photography/features/cameras-on-32-interplanetary-spacecraft class="colorbox colorbox-insert-image" rel=nofollow><amp-img layout="responsive" alt="" class="image-960" src="https://static.bhphotovideo.com/explora/sites/default/files/styles/960/public/solar_orbiter_1.jpg?itok=BsWFB7EB" width="960" height="679" /></a><figcaption>Artist rendition of the Solar Orbiter</figcaption></figure></div><p>The Solar Orbiter has 10 separate instruments, all working in conjunction to provide the spacecraft's suite of data. Of those instruments, the Metis (coronograph), PHI (Polarimetric and Helioseismic Imager), and SoloHi (Solar Orbiter Heliospheric Imager) are all on board to take photos.</p><div class="caption-div"><figure class="caption-figure caption-image-body"><a href=https://www.bhphotovideo.com/explora/photography/features/cameras-on-32-interplanetary-spacecraft class="colorbox colorbox-insert-image" rel=nofollow><amp-img layout="responsive" alt="" class="image-960" src="https://static.bhphotovideo.com/explora/sites/default/files/styles/960/public/solar_orbiter_2.jpg?itok=1o9pmvF2" width="960" height="907" /></a><figcaption>Solar Orbiter</figcaption></figure></div><p>Metis sees both ultraviolet and visible light with intensified active pixel sensors at 1024 x 1024 and 2048 x 2048 resolution, respectively.

And SoloHi is a visible light telescope that projects images to a mosaic of four 2048x1920 detectors that are read out independently.</p><h3>30. Surveyor Missions</h3><p>The Surveyor projects, from 1966-68, were unmanned landers sent to the moon in preparation for the Apollo missions to follow. Surveyor differed from the earlier Ranger missions in that the probes made soft landings on the moon's surface. They tested the technology that would be used in later missions and accumulated much data on lunar chemical and soil minerals and returned almost 90,000 images from five separate sites.</p><div class="caption-div"><figure class="caption-figure caption-image-body"><amp-img layout="responsive" alt="" class="image-960" src="https://static.bhphotovideo.com/explora/sites/default/files/styles/960/public/surveyor.jpg?itok=JbyfnDs8" width="960" height="720" /><figcaption>Surveyor</figcaption></figure></div><p>Each Surveyor spacecraft carried a television camera and 70mm pictures were obtained at very high resolution. This photography provided information on the nature of the surface terrain in the immediate vicinity of the spacecraft, as well as the number, distribution, and sizes of the craters and boulders in the area. In addition, a non-landing camera platform was used to map the whole moon from orbit.</p><div class="caption-div"><figure class="caption-figure caption-image-body"><a href=https://www.bhphotovideo.com/explora/photography/features/cameras-on-32-interplanetary-spacecraft class="colorbox colorbox-insert-image" rel=nofollow><amp-img layout="responsive" alt="" class="image-960" src="https://static.bhphotovideo.com/explora/sites/default/files/styles/960/public/surveyor7_moon.jpg?itok=OqXbEvVQ" width="625" height="480" /></a><figcaption>Despite the more hazardous terrain in the landing area, Surveyor 7 landed without incident. In addition to acquiring a wide variety of lunar surface data, Surveyor 7 also took pictures of Earth and performed star surveys. Laser beams from Earth were successfully detected by the craft's television camera in a special test of laser-pointing techniques.</figcaption></figure></div><p>Surveyor images included wide-angle and narrow-angle panoramas, focus ranging surveys, photometric surveys, special area surveys, and celestial photography.</p><p>The Apollo 12 Lunar Module landed near Surveyor 3 on November 19, 1969. Astronauts Conrad and Bean examined the spacecraft, and they brought back about 10 kg of parts of the Surveyor to the Earth, including its TV camera, which is now on permanent display in the National Air and Space Museum, in Washington, D.C.</p><h3>31. Viking Series</h3><p>The Viking 1 and 2 probes, launched in 1975 and both consisted of an orbiter and landers, which safely settled on the surface of Mars. They landed approximately two months apart in late 1976 and operated until 1982 and 1980, respectively.</p><div class="caption-div"><figure class="caption-figure caption-image-body"><amp-img layout="responsive" alt="" class="image-960" src="https://static.bhphotovideo.com/explora/sites/default/files/styles/960/public/261003main_02_Viking1_full.jpg?itok=WdWLWKw_" width="960" height="720" /><figcaption>Viking</figcaption></figure></div><p>The Viking Lander camera design was very different from vidicon framing or CCD array cameras. The lander camera was a facsimile camera with a single, stationary photo-sensor array (PSA), and azimuth and elevation scanning mechanisms. A lander image was generated by scanning the scene in two directions (elevation and azimuth) to focus light onto the photo-sensor array. Its two identical cameras were bolted to the top of the lander body.</p><div class="caption-div"><figure class="caption-figure caption-image-body"><a href=https://www.bhphotovideo.com/explora/photography/features/cameras-on-32-interplanetary-spacecraft class="colorbox colorbox-insert-image" rel=nofollow><amp-img layout="responsive" alt="" class="image-960" src="https://static.bhphotovideo.com/explora/sites/default/files/styles/960/public/PIA01522.jpg?itok=gxnzEU3d" width="960" height="758" /></a><figcaption>The boulder-strewn field of red rocks reaches to the horizon nearly two miles from Viking 2, on Mars's Utopian Plain.</figcaption></figure></div><p>The lenses had a 0.95 cm aperture diameter and 5.37 cm focal length. 4,500 images from the landers and 52,000 pictures from the orbiters were sent back to Earth.</p><h3>32. Voyager Series</h3><p>The legendary explorers of our solar system, Voyager 1 and Voyager 2 were both launched in 1977 and are still actively returning data from interstellar space after their grand tours of our family of planets! Voyager 1 has been in interstellar space since August 2012 and is the farthest human-made object from the Sun (and Earth). Voyager 2 has visited its destinations-all four gas giant planets-and entered interstellar space in November 2018. The Voyager probes' primary mission was the exploration of Jupiter and Saturn after which Voyager 1 was flung off the ecliptic towards the unknown. Voyager 2 continued on and gave us the first close-up tour Uranus and Neptune.</p><div class="caption-div"><figure class="caption-figure caption-image-body"><amp-img layout="responsive" alt="" class="image-960" src="https://static.bhphotovideo.com/explora/sites/default/files/styles/960/public/voyager.jpg?itok=rqOxu99d" width="792" height="446" /><figcaption>Voyager <em>(artist's rendition)</em></figcaption></figure></div><p>The Imaging Science Subsystem (ISS) on the Voyager probes is a modified version of the slow-scan vidicon camera designs that were used in the earlier Mariner flights. The ISS consists of two television-type cameras, each with 8 filters in a commandable filter wheel mounted in front of the vidicons.</p><div class="caption-div"><figure class="caption-figure caption-image-body"><a href=https://www.bhphotovideo.com/explora/photography/features/cameras-on-32-interplanetary-spacecraft class="colorbox colorbox-insert-image" rel=nofollow><amp-img layout="responsive" alt="" class="image-960" src="https://static.bhphotovideo.com/explora/sites/default/files/styles/960/public/redspotx.gif?itok=GfdqK9Nh" width="895" height="848" /></a><figcaption>Voyager snapped a photo of Jupiter's Great Red Spot.</figcaption></figure></div><p>One system has a low-resolution, 200mm wide-angle lens with an aperture of f/3, while the other has a higher-resolution 1500mm narrow-angle f/8.5 lens. On February 14, 1990, Voyager 1 took the last pictures of the Voyager mission. After that set of portraits, the cameras on Voyager 1 and 2 were switched off and the software controlling them removed from the spacecraft.</p><div ><em>Images courtesy NASA, JPL, APL</em></div></div></div></div> </div> <a class="comments" href="https://www.bhphotovideo.com/explora/photography/features/cameras-on-32-interplanetary-spacecraft#comments">80 comments</a> <a class="original-article" href="https://www.bhphotovideo.com/explora/photography/features/cameras-on-32-interplanetary-spacecraft">View original article</a></div> </div></div> </div> </article><footer id="page-footer"><div class="footer-links"> <div class="footer-main-menu"> <ul><li> <a href="tel:8006066969">800.606.6969</a> </li> <li> <a href="https://www.bhphotovideo.com/find/HelpCenter/HoursOfOperation.jsp">Store Hours</a> </li> <li> <a href="https://www.bhphotovideo.com/find/HelpCenter/helpcenter.jsp">Help Center</a> </li> <li> <a href="https://www.bhphotovideo.com/find/HelpCenter/AboutUs.jsp">About Us</a> </li> <li class="mailto"> <a href="https://www.bhphotovideo.com/find/HelpCenter/helpcenter.jsp#contact-us">Contact Us</a> </li> <li> <a href="https://www.bhphotovideo.com/find/HelpCenter/int-shippingRulesPolicies.jsp">International</a> </li> <li> <a href="https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/buy/Gift-Cards/ci/4928/N/4288591605">B&amp;H Gift Card</a> </li> <li> <a href="https://www.bhphotovideo.com/find/eventDetails.jsp">Event Space</a> </li> <li> <a href="https://www.bhphotovideo.com/find/eduAdvantage.jsp">Students/<wbr>Educators</wbr></a> </li> <li> <a href="https://www.bhphotovideo.com/find/HelpCenter/ReturnExchange.jsp">Return Policy</a> </li> </ul><div class="clearfix"></div> </div> </div> <div class="footer-copy"> <div class="left copy-links font13 whale"> <span class="copyright"> <span class="company-name light">Â© 2000-2021 B &amp; H Foto &amp; Electronics Corp.</span> <span class="company-address light"> 420 9th Ave, New York, NY 10001.</span> </span> <span class="privacy-security"> <a href="https://www.bhphotovideo.com/find/HelpCenter/PrivacySecurity.jsp">Privacy &amp; Security.</a> <a href="https://www.bhphotovideo.com/find/HelpCenter/UserAgreement.jsp"> Terms of Use.</a> </span> </div> <div class="clearfix"></div> </div> </footer></div></div></body>
